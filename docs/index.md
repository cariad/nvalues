# NValues introduction

**NValues** is a Python package for working with _n_-dimensional volumes of data.

For example, to create a spreadsheet-like grid of float values with alphabetic `x` keys and integer `y` keys:

```python
from nvalues import Volume

grid = Volume[tuple[str, int], float]()
grid["A", 0] = 1.2
grid["B", 1] = 1.4
grid["C", 2] = 1.6

print(grid["A", 0])
# 1.2
```

See the [`Volume` class](/volume) for more detail, or if you don't need more than five dimensions then see the [`Line`](/line), [`Grid`](/grid), [`Cube`](/cube), [`Tesseract`](/tesseract) or [`Penteract`](/penteract) wrapper classes for an easier life.

## Installation

**NValues** requires Python 3.9 or later and can be installed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/nvalues/):
